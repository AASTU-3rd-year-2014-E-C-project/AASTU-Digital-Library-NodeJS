                            while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a
                            dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with
                            the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley-a great big
                            swollen spoiled bully. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he
                            hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a
                            mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible
                            place that Harry-and anyone who reads about him-will find unforgettable. For it's there that
                            he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but
                            a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>
